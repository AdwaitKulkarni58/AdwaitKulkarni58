# Who am I:  
- Hi, I’m Adwait! I am currently in my second-year studying computer science at The University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada!  
- I’m interested in all things programming and logic related! Especially solving puzzles and problems!  
  
<hr />   
  
# What I am doing right now:    
- I’m currently participating in Google's Software Product Sprint as well as making open source contributions on the side!
- My latest big project was a full-stack application, a user management system which I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(EJS) on the front-end with an Express.js and MongoDB back-end in a Node.js runtime environment.  
- I have built some projects related to front-end development and I recently made some projects related to APIs and a full stack Netflix clone. Currently I am studying the MERN stack and to be specific, right now I am expanding my knowledge on the Javascript framework React.js.

# What I believe in:
- Plan before code!!! This is as important as it gets, having a blueprint and a roadmap of the entire project is a must before writing a single line of code.
- I love to draw out sketches and list possible approaches to a scenario before deciding on the best one.
- Design principles matter. You can make your code a lot more faster, efficient, and easier to read by using the SOLID principles.
- Separation of concerns and singular responsibility. It is really easy to include your styles in your logic file but that does not translate into healthy code style. Build a file structure first and then start writing code as per responsibilities.

# What do my future plans include: (nothing too far ahead I promise)  
- Learn about React.js to complete my understanding of the MERN stack.
- Most importantly, build lots of projects, both small and large to solidify my understanding of different topics and how to combine them together to build a full-stack application from scratch.

# Challenges I face daily:  
- I have been learning these new things from tutorials and documentation online and one thing I struggle with daily is the overdose of information available on the web. I am trying to take things one at a time and not rush anything as to have a complete and fulfilling learning experience.  
- Another challenge I face daily is the combination of multiple technologies involved in building projects. I sometimes get overwhelmed when I am beginning to build a project but what I have learned is to break down a project idea into multiple small pieces (I call this separating the bones from the meat) and concentrate on the small pieces one at a time. In the end, when all the pieces are handled, simply combine them together!
