# Who am I:  
- Hi, I’m Adwait! I am currently in my fourth year majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada!  
- I’m interested in all things programming and logic-related! I especially have a keen interest in real-time analysis of data and am trying to build projects that expose me to the same!
- A weird thing about me is that I always have ideas for potential projects running through my mind throughout the day even though I hardly get the time to build any.

# What I am doing right now:    
- I'm currently building projects using the MERN stack and integrating message-based systems like RabbitMQ into these projects. I have also worked extensively with Spring Boot applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices.
- I am also actively working on multiple full-stack projects and one of these includes a full-stack e-commerce store that I created from scratch recently!  
- I am also learning Apache Kafka on the side and upskilling myself in Python as well.

# What I believe in:
- Design, design, design. And plan out the architecture before writing any code!!! This is as important as it gets, having a blueprint and a roadmap of the entire project is a must before writing a single line of code.
- I love to draw out sketches and list possible approaches to a scenario before deciding on the best one.
- Design principles matter. You can make your code a lot more faster, efficient, and easier to read by using industry-standard practices and principles.
- Separation of concerns and singular responsibilities (part of why I am in love with React). It is really easy to include your styles in your logic file but that does not translate into healthy code style. Build a file structure first and then start writing code as per responsibilities.

# What my future plans include: (nothing too far ahead I promise)  
- Dive back into Python and this time, go the distance and get some good data-related projects on my profile.
- Make more meaningful contributions to open source and interact with the community to get an understanding of what the best code practices are, how code reviews should be conducted, what types of issues today's developers are facing, and how open source tools can be used to solve those issues.
- Most importantly, convert some of my ideas into code and solidify my understanding of different topics about how to combine them to build full-stack applications.  

<hr />

# Challenges I face daily:  
- I have been learning these new things from tutorials and documentation online and one thing I struggle with daily is the overdose of information available on the web. I am trying to take things one at a time and not rush anything as to have a complete and fulfilling learning experience.  
- Another challenge I face daily is the combination of multiple technologies involved in building projects. I sometimes get overwhelmed when I am beginning to build a project but what I have learned is to break down a project idea into multiple small pieces (I call this separating the bones from the meat) and concentrate on the small pieces one at a time. In the end, when all the pieces are handled, simply combine them together!
