# Who am I:  
- Hi, I’m Adwait! I am currently in my second-year studying computer science at The University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada!  
- I’m interested in all things programming and logic related! Especially solving puzzles and problems!  
  
<hr />   
  
# What I am doing right now:    
- I’m currently learning web development!  
- I have built some projects related to front-end development and I recently made some projects related to APIs. Currently I am studying the MERN stack and to be specific, right now I am learning Express.js.  

<hr />

# What do my future plans include: (nothing too far ahead I promise)  
- Learn the backend, especially Mongo. Then learn a Javascript framework, particularly React to complete the MERN stack.  
- Most importantly, build lots of projects, both small and large to solidify my understanding of different topics and how to combine them together to build a full-stack application from scratch.  
- One of my personal goals include constructing the backend to the front-end Netflix clone I built a few months ago so that I can tell my friends and family that I recreated Netflix from scratch!

# Challenges I face daily:  
- I have been learning these new things from tutorials and documentation online and one thing I struggle with daily is the overdose of information available on the web. I am trying to take things one at a time and not rush anything as to have a complete and fulfilling learning experience.  
- Another challenge I face daily is the combination of multiple technologies involved in building projects. I sometimes get overwhelmed when I am beginning to build a project but what I have learned is to break down a project idea into multiple small pieces (I call this separating the bones from the meat) and concentrate on the small pieces one at a time. In the end, when all the pieces are handled, simply combine them together!
